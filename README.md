# mobile-dealership-ethereum

This project is mainly built to have an understanding of how the public blockchain technology(Ethereum) works. I have used solidity(language) to write the contract, truffle, ganache, javascript, html, css.
-> Truffle Suite is a development environment based on Ethereum Blockchain, used to develop DApps (Distributed Applications).
-> Ganache is a personal blockchain for rapid Ethereum distributed application development.

The project maintains the ownership of the mobile phone based on IMEI number. 
- Suppose a mobile has been stole, if the robber would sell the cell phone he must know the password to change the owner details into his details.
- The buyer would know all the mobile details such as warranty due, the cost price, the place of purchase hence the chances of being fooled by the seller is reduced.
